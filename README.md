## Autogami

Autogami is a hardware hack project completed at Cornell Make-a-thon 2019 in Feburary. We designed a system that changes the capabilities of a 3D printer so that it could act as a origami creaser to create accurate folds. It was integrated with a web app that allows users to select a specific crease pattern. That image would then get sent to a computer vision algorithm that would determine the location of the creases.
